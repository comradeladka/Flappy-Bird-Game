Flappy Bird Game â€“ Play in Your Browser!
This is my creative spin on the legendary Flappy Bird game â€“ rebuilt from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Tap, flap, and test your reflexes as you guide the bird through endless pipes. Every pass adds a point, every crash teaches you to fly better.

âœ¨ Why this game?
Because simple games are timeless. One button, endless fun.
Built to look and feel like the Play Store version, but coded completely in the browser.

1.Classic flappy gameplay recreated with smooth physics

2.Responsive controls (Spacebar or Mouse Click)

3.Randomly generated pipes for a new challenge each round
